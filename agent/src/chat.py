    Stream chat responses in Server-Sent Events (SSE) format compatible with OpenAI's chat completions API.

    This function acts as a streaming endpoint that:
    1. Takes a chat request with a user question
    2. Streams the agent's response as SSE events
    3. Formats each event according to OpenAI's streaming format
    4. Handles errors gracefully within the stream

    Args:
        request: ChatRequest object containing the user's question and optional parameters

    Yields:
        str: SSE-formatted events in the format "data: {json_event}\n\n"
             Each event contains answer chunks from the agent
             Stream ends with "data: [DONE]"

    Event Format:
        Each yielded event is a JSON object with structure:
        {
            "type": "answer_chunk",
            "content": "text content from the agent"
        }

    Error Handling:
        If an exception occurs during streaming, yields an error event:
        {
            "type": "error",
            "content": "error message"
        }

    Example:
        async for event in stream_chat(ChatRequest(question="What is the capital of France?")):
            print(event)  # "data: {\"type\": \"answer_chunk\", \"content\": \"Paris\"}\n\n"
    """
