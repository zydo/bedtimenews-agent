    Stream answer chunks and intermediate reasoning steps from the agentic RAG workflow.

    This function executes the LangGraph workflow and streams both intermediate steps
    and final answer content, providing visibility into the RAG pipeline progress.

    Args:
        question: The user's input question or query string

    Yields:
        dict: Events with structure:
            {
                "type": "step" | "answer_chunk" | "answer_final",

                "content": "step description or text content"
            }

    Event Types:
        - "step": Intermediate pipeline steps with descriptions
        - "answer_chunk": LLM-generated answer content
        - "citations": {"urls": {episode_name: transcript_url}}, emitted after
          grading and before the first chunk, so clients can linkify citations
          while the answer streams.
        - "followups": {"items": [question, ...]}, suggested next questions
          parsed out of the completion after the answer. The raw token stream
          still contains the delimiter and this block, so clients must hide
          everything from FOLLOWUPS_DELIMITER onward while streaming.
        - "answer_final": {"content", "grounded"} — the completed,
          post-processed answer. Clients should render it in place of the text
          they accumulated. Sent only when the client could not arrive at the
          same text itself: a citation repair changed something, or nothing
          streamed at all.
        - "answer_meta": {"grounded"} — sent instead of answer_final when the
          streamed text is already correct. Carries whether the turn was
          answered from retrieved documents, which the client sends back as
          ChatTurn.grounded on the next request.

    Steps Emitted:
        1. "route": Initial routing decision (direct/RAG)
        2. "rewrite": Query optimization
        3. "retrieve": Document retrieval results
        4. "grade": Document grading results
        5. "generate": Final answer generation (streamed as chunks)

    Example:
        async for event in agent_stream_query("What is the capital of France?"):
            if event["type"] == "step":
                print(f"[{event['step']}] {event['content']}")
            else:
